COMP 2406 - Term Project Assignment: Option A

Name: Jacob Bonner
ID: 101234823

Node Version: v16.17.0
OS: Windows 10

Install: socket.io (command to install: npm install socket.io)
Launch: node server.js

Testing: Use Chrome browser or another browser to visit: http://localhost:3000/curling.html
Testing Instructions: Typically when I have done testing, side by side tabs are what I
		      used to easily see the synchronization. The server will allow a
		      client to change roles on refreshing (since it treats it as a
		      disconnect), assuming there is still the player or visitor roles
		      to choose from. Otherwise, spectator will be the only option. Other
		      than this, the testing should be fairly straight forward across all
		      clients.
